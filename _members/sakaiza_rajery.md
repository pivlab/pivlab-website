Sakaiza is a first year student in the [Human Medical Genetics and Genomics Program (HMGG)](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/graduate-programs/human-medical-genetics-and-genomics/home).

She is interested in the development of computational methods that integrates mutli-omics data at different levels to prevent diseases and better diverse population health.
In her rotation with the Pividori Lab she is using [PhenoPLIER](https://github.com/greenelab/phenoplier) with whole blood transcriptomics data from the [Diabetes Auto Immunity Study in the Young (DAISY)](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/barbara-davis-center-for-diabetes/research/clinical-epidemiology/daisy-research) cohort to identify gene modules that are differentially expressed in individuals with specific Auto Immunnity pattern and infer specific tissue or cells where the modules are expressed.
