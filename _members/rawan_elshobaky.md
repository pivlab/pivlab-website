Rawan is a first-year PhD student in the [Human Medical Genetics and Genomics Program (HMGGP)](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/graduate-programs/human-medical-genetics-and-genomics/home), rotating in the Pividori lab in winter 2025.
She graduated from Johns Hopkins University with a B.S. in Molecular and Cellular Biology and minors in Computer Science and Bioethics.
Her research interests focus on improving disease risk prediction in underrepresented populations. During her rotation, Rawan will evaluate
the performance of polygenic risk scores (PRS), predicted transcriptome risk scores (PTRS), and latent variable risk scores (LVRS) for
thyroid cancer. She will train models in European-ancestry populations and test them in African-ancestry individuals in the UK Biobank to
identify approaches that enhance cross-ancestry prediction, advancing equitable precision medicine.
