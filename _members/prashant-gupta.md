Prashant is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Pividori Lab](/) in the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/dbmi) and the [Colorado Center for Personalized Medicine (CCPM)](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/ccpm) at the [University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/).

Prior to joining the Pividori Lab, Prashant earned his PhD in Mathematics at Washington State University with specializing in computational topology, computational geometry, discrete optimization, and computational complexity. Passionate about solving complex problems with data-driven and mathematical tools, Prashant has worked on theoritical and computational models in additive manufacturing, neuromorphic computing, and oil & gas research. 
As a PostDoc in the Pividori Lab, Prashant is focused on developing machine-learning tool ensuring the reliability, interpretability, and explainability impact on our gene modules across diverse genomic datasets.

Outside of research, he enjoy hiking, pickleball, badminton, ecstatic dancing, and deep philosophical discussions.
